# Deksmo

**The Ultimate Local Manga-to-PDF Archiver**

Turn your scattered manga image folders into clean, high-quality PDF chapters instantly. Deksmo is built for speed, privacy, and preserving the visual fidelity of your collection.

## ✨ Features

*   **📂 Folder-to-Chapter Intelligence**
    Simply select a parent folder. Deksmo automatically groups images into chapters based on their subfolders.

*   **🔢 Smart Numeric Sorting**
    Tired of "Page 10" appearing before "Page 2"? Deksmo uses natural sorting algorithms to ensure your pages are perfectly ordered (1, 2, ... 9, 10).

*   **🔒 100% Local & Private**
    No servers. No uploads. Your files never leave your device. All processing happens directly in your browser.

*   **💎 Lossless Quality**
    Unlike other converters that shrink pages to A4 or Letter size, Deksmo creates PDFs where every page matches the exact pixel dimensions of the source image. No blur, no cropping.

*   **⚡ Batch Processing**
    Queue up hundreds of chapters and export them all with a single click.

*   **👁️ Visual Inspection**
    Check your chapters before exporting. Use the built-in lightbox to read pages or remove accidental duplicates.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Open Deksmo** in your browser.
2.  Click **"Add Folders"** (or Import Folders).
3.  Select the **Parent Directory** containing your manga chapters (e.g., `Manga Name/`).
    *   *Structure example:* `Manga Name/Chapter 01/[images...]`
4.  Deksmo will organize the subfolders into chapter cards.
5.  Click **"Export All"** to download PDFs for every chapter at once, or use the individual **PDF** buttons.
